<li><h3>Why use your site instead of a regular personal trainer?</h3></li>
-An automated program will keep track of your previous workouts better than any human possibly could<br><br>
-much cheaper<br><br>
-our site is built around an accepted model for personal training, and the algorithms implemented to generate workouts are intelligent and consistent.  Our program can be delivered simultaneously to all of our clientelle, so signing up for our program will not result in an unlucky pairing of an inexperiened human trainer that you may otherwise be stuck with at a gym.<br><br>
<li><h3>What sets your website apart from other personal training websites?</h3></li>
-other sites are one size fits all<br><br>
-workouts from other computer generated sites are pre-fabricated.  Our program intelligently builds workouts from an extensive and intricate database <br><br>
-if not that, then they're not automated.  They're programs hand written by personal trainers<br><br>
-because our site is an actual application built around a database and capable of delivering dynamic content, we can keep our prices low and still deliver the results you want<br><br>
-our site is a synergy of fitness and programming expertise - a difficult combination to find<br><br>
<li><h3>Wouldn't a human be able to build a better workout for me than a computer?</h3></li>
-Yes and no.  Some people hire trainers as a motivational factor.  Our website can't stand beside you in the gym and count the reps you do and scream motivational words, but it can design workouts in an intelligent manner based on the same factors that a personal trainer would use<br><br>
-A personal trainer is not necessarily an exercise guru.  To become trainers, they have to take tests that certify them, and they are in essence taught the same model that our web application is built upon, and gyms expect them to train clients in accordance with that model.  Hence, a personal trainer will not be able to design workouts any more effectively than our own program<br><br>
-At the end of the day, the bottom line in your program's effectiveness is whether or not you put in the work.  Consistency is the true key to success in physical fitness, and in that aspect a personal trainer can't compete with our website.  With an automated system that is available to you at your own convenience and with a price that a trainer can't compete with, our program is much more useable for long-term use<br><br>
<li><h3>How does your program work?</h3></li>
-our whole application is built around an exercise database composed of hundreds of exercises.  Each exercise is appropriately tagged for which muscle group it works and is also categorized into the type of exercise it is (flexibility, resistance, reactive, etc...).  The equipment required is also tagged so that you only receive exercises which you are capable of doing based on what resources are available to you.  Once you input what your own personal goal is, workout phases are pulled from the database that are relevant to your goal and last for weeks at a time.  Every week your training regimen is compiled based on that WHATEVER WHATEVER MODEL IT IS ADAM USED and your current phase to distribute the types of exercises you should be doing on a day to day basis.  A pool of relevant exercises are filtered daily based on the amount of recuperation each muscle group and your own experience and fitness level.  The pool is intelligently randomized and delivered in such a fashion that will keep your muscles and your nervous system constantly adapting and evolving to reach your goal, and the exercises are fit to meet your own time schedule.  <br><br>
